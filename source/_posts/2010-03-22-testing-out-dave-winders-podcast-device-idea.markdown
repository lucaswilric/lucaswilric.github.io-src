After that I tried installing the Wordpress app, in which I'm typing this post. The app, it appears, doesn't support audio uploads. Pics yes, audio no.

Obviously I'll have to do a bit more work on this, and maybe if I still feel like a Winer fanboy in a couple of days I'll do a "for poets" howto on the subject.

**Edit:** I totally didn't read that last sentence before I posted. The Android keyboard is OK, but its predictive fu is not perfect.
