If you're wondering whether to write that piece, thinking "it's been done before," don't wonder - write it. Don't hesitate to air an idea just because somebody else has had it before. You're not original - so what? Even if you don't have an original idea, you may have an original expression of it. Show the idea your own way and perhaps something valuable will come of it, for you or for somebody else. You may provide somebody with an "Aha!" moment, which others had previously failed to do.

Don't strive to be original. Nobody's all that original - human brains don't work that way. Strive to be clear, because the world needs more clarity. Your uniqueness will show through your work.
