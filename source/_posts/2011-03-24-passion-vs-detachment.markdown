title: Passion vs detachment
---
I'm confused about something, namely: how you can be both passionate and detached.

Example: I was working on a problem the other day, something about grade point averages for a graduate employment campaign. This problem and I have a history. I was determined to solve it, if not once and for all, then as close as practical. Then I ran into a roadblock - something or other to do with writing results back to a database. The details aren't important. I asked my 1up for help, and he obliged by telling me that I should change my approach and avoid the roadblock completely.

I hated that idea. Admittedly I was already a bit cranky because I was hungry (cf. my blood sugar issues), but I was also really attached to *my* way of solving the problem. The idea that we should take a few extra steps for caution's sake (like not writing to the DB before we check the results) was repugnant. Surely we should just get it *done*, right?

The problem here is that I was attached to my solution, not to solving the problem. So how do we avoid that? How can you be both passionate about solving a problem, and detached from your solution?"
