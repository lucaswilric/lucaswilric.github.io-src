From the BBC:

<object width="512" height="400"><param name="movie" value="http://www.bbc.co.uk/emp/external/player.swf"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"></param><param name="FlashVars" value="playlist=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Ebbc%2Eco%2Euk%2Fbritainfromabove%2Fintl%2Fplaylist%5F92%2Exml&config_settings_showFooter=true&"></param><embed src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/emp/external/player.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="512" height="400" FlashVars="playlist=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Ebbc%2Eco%2Euk%2Fbritainfromabove%2Fintl%2Fplaylist%5F92%2Exml&config_settings_showFooter=true&"></embed></object>

More time-shifting would make this less of a problem :P

Seriously though, can you imagine what would happen if someone was actually *trying* to hurt that network?
