I recently got an email from somebody I didn't know, who had made some improvements to <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/9433">a Greasemonkey script</a> I wrote and put on Userscripts.org.

This would not normally be significant, except that it's the first time that this has happened to me. It makes me feel that I've written something worth having and improving, and hence something potentially useful, regardless of its quality. It might even be an idea that's worth being proud of, and as far as software ideas go, that's a new one too.

Hopefully this is something that happens to everyone, but I'm guessing it's not. So I'd really like to thank the contributor who did this for me. You made my day.
