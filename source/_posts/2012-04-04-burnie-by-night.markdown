My sweetie and I started our sojourn yesterday, to sunny Tasmania. We arrived in Launceston, stayed there for a night, and then spent today driving to Burnie. Not a very long drive under normal circumstances, but we chose the scenic route :)

Here's a photo I took on our walk this evening. Please excuse the crappy resolution - it turns out I had it set far too low:
