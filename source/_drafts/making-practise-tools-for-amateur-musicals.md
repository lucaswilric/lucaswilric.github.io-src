Intro - MDing a musical with un-auditioned chorus, where some people need a lot of help learning their stuff. I was also re-arranging some pieces, and needed to produce scores for my arrangements. I also wanted to provide practise tracks for people to use at home, consisting of a piano backing and a voice singing their part.

# MuseScore

* MIDI input
* WYSIWYG editing
* Plain-text output in standard format (MusicXML). Not by default, but better than Sibelius. Excellent for version control, because it de-dupes and compresses much better.
* Pretty good help from the community
* Does the important 80%
* Score production feeds into practise track production via MIDI output

# GarageBand

Entry level tool for recording and mixing. All I really need.
Talked to a friend for some nicer piano sounds.
Asked other friends to record soprano and alto parts.
Recorded voices singing each part over the top. Able to isolate voices for learning individual parts, combine for part-singing practise, or remove voices and leave only instruments for rehearsals where a pianist was unavailable.

# Adjusting tempos

Just used Audacity. It's not pretty software, but it has the tools that do the job, and lets you change speed by saying "I want to change it from X to Y bpm", so you don't need to calculate the % change yourself. Sensible, since that's exactly the kind of thing that computers do better than humans.

# Testing the arrangements

I got a trusted group of singers together to help me (a) hear the arrangements with real voices, (b) find the bits that would require the most preparation before rehearsing with the cast, and (c) pick out bugs in the scores. These were musicians I've spent a lot of time singing with and many of them also had conducting experience, so they knew exactly what to look for. They found lots of places where either I or the composer was unclear about something, which gave me the opportunity to clarify it before presenting it to the cast.
