I'm Lucas Wilson-Richter. I'm a software engineer by day and a classical baritone slash choral conductor by night. I read books, articles, blogs and tweets. I sing by myself and with a few different choirs. I'm employed by [Redbubble](http://www.redbubble.com/). I listen to lots of music that features pianos. I use Debian, OSX and Android. I tread the boards in light operas. I occasionally indulge in scene shifting and musically directing theatre shows. I drink coffee every day, and beer, wine and whiskey some days. I'm passionate about tech, teaching and music.
